The Resting-state, Working Memory, Language and Math, Relational, Social Cognition, Emotion, Gambling, and Motor fMRI scans from the S1200 Human Connectome Project release were analyzed. 
Brains were normalized to fslr32k via the MSM-AII registration.
CompCor, with five principal components from the ventricles and white matter masks, was used to regress out nuisance signals from the time series.
In addition, the 12 detrended motion estimates provided by the Human Connectome Project were regressed out from the regional time series.
The mean global signal was removed and then time series were band- pass filtered from 0.009 to 0.08 Hz.
Finally, frames with greater than 0.2 mm frame-wise displacement or a derivative root mean square (DVARS) above 75 were removed as outliers.
Segments of less than five uncensored time points were also removed. Sessions composed of greater than 50 percent outlier frames were not further analyzed.
